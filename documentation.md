# Smolok

Smolok is a backend services platform for the Internet Of Things enablement. Smolok is based on the top of the leading
open source projects including [Eclipse IoT stack](http://iot.eclipse.org) and [Red Hat software](https://www.redhat.com/en).

The idea behind Smolok is to provide a scalable out-of-the-box PaaS platform providing core IoT services (like device
management, telemetry reading/writing, etc), big data analytics and IoT-scale messaging infrastructure.
